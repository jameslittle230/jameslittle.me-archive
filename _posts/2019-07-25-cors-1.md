title:  "Why do we encounter CORS errors?"

There are certain types of web development errors that can be pretty confusing: "CORS," or _Cross-Origin Resource Sharing_ related errors. These errors pop up when the web browser is trying to protect you from potential security vulnerabilities. When you don't expect them, though, they can be pretty confusing.

CORS errors occur when the browser is:

1. asked to load a remote resource (like a script, font, a page via AJAX, a WebGL texture, but not, notably, an image via the `<img>` tag) and that image is
2. from an _external domain_ (a domain that isn't the same as the one in your address bar),
3. but the server doesn't specify that the original domain is allowed to use that resource.

When that's the case, the browser will stop itself from loading the file, and will throw an error like the one above in the Javascript console.

**Why does the browser want to stop this from happening?** Imagine I want to steal information from a victim website. I set up an evil website that loads a script from the victim site's server. Without CORS protections in place, my evil site can download and run the victim site's script and send the victim site's data back to me. In this way, servers can protect themselves from inappropriate content access.

Unfortunately, this means that if you build a site and an external service from which it loads data, you'll have to set up this external service so that it knows it is allowed to serve data when the site is asking for it.

In the case of the [Bowdoin Orient's site](https://bowdoinorient.com), the font CDN[^1] lives on a different server from the actual site itself. That means the original page (the origin, or `https://bowdoinorient.com`) is trying to load content from a different domain (`font-cdn.bowdoinorient.co`). If we don't set up the font CDN server to allow itself to serve content to pages on `bowdoinorient.com`, the browser will refuse to load that content, meaning (in this case) our fonts will break.

My goal is to create a short guide that explains what's going on when you encounter these weird error messages, and to describe what the browser expects from the files it downloads and why.

## HTTP and Headers

Let's talk about the HyperText Transfer Protocol.

What happens when you go to a website, like `https://jameslittle.me`? On a high level, your browser sends an HTTP request (which is just a bit of text) to my server, and my server, via a program like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) that runs continuously and is built to answer web requests, sends back an HTTP response with the contents of my web page.

Every time a web page loads, several of these HTTP requests are sent: the first one is for the HTML document that was requested, and the rest are for any images, scripts, fonts, or stylesheets that the HTML document says is needed. The first one is directly related to the page you asked for in your browser's address bar; any others are automatically sent by the browser as specified by the first document the browser gets back. For each request that gets sent, the server to which it gets sent responds with the data the browser asked for. Those request/response pairs make up the contents of the web page, and control what your browser displays to you.

</figure>

We can dig into the request/response pairs in greater depth by looking at them in the Web Inspector.[^2] Each request and response has two parts: the _headers_ and the _payload_.

The headers define configuration and other metadata for the message. They are plain-text key-value pairs that go at the beginning of both HTTP requests and responses. HTTP request headers are messages that the _browser_ wants to tell the _server_, while HTTP response headers are messages that the _server_ wants to tell the _browser_.

The payload for an HTTP _response_ will almost always be the contents of the requested file. HTTP requests can sometimes have a payload, though most of the time this payload is empty — usually, an HTTP request only consists of headers describing the file the browser is asking for.

## How HTTP headers relate to the CORS mechanism

Headers serve many different purposes. The ones we're interested in deal with **security**: namely, deciding whether a web browser has the permission to use a given file from a non-origin server.[^3] When writing a server-side program, you can choose which HTTP headers you want to tack onto a given response. Tacking on certain headers to your server-side response can tell the browser [a ton of different things](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers), but in the case of CORS errors:

- Which _origin_ is allowed to use the downloaded content
- Which HTTP headers are allowed to be included with the request
- Which HTTP methods are allowed to be used on a given endpoint

> **Note:** the file is always downloaded, but if the browser finds itself in a situation that would break the CORS policy, it will refuse to load the file's contents: the script won't run, the stylesheet won't get used, etc.

Therefore, if you're getting console warnings about CORS headers not being properly included, it means you have to change the configuration on your server: your server needs to be including HTTP headers in the response so that the browser knows it's allowed to use the file it downloaded.

## What kinds of headers should I include?

It sort of depends on what your browser is asking for — while the console error messages might not immediately be clear, you can usually tell which header is missing from the error message. In the example above, the server needs to attach the **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`** header with a value that says that `bowdoinorient.com` pages are allowed to use the font file.

This value can take one of three options. First, we could configure the value as `*`, which indicates that _every site_ is allowed to see the given resource. Second, we can specify a single origin, such as `bowdoinorient.com`. Third, we can specify the origin `null`, although this option apparently [should not be used](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-cors-for-developers/#avoid-returning-access-control-allow-origin-null).

Other headers might include:

**`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`**: describes which HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are allowed to be used on a given URI. When you use Javascript to make an AJAX request, sometimes it will send a _preflight request_: an additional request beforehand to see what sorts of requests the browser is allowed to make before it actually makes the request. The server will respond with this header to let the browser (and, ultimately, you) know what kinds of HTTP methods you can use next.

**`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`**: describes which request headers are allowed to be sent while asking for a given resource. For example, the browser (again, through Javascript) might specify in a request header that it wants JSON-only responses (`content-type: JSON` would be the header tacked onto the HTTP request). If you send a server a header it doesn't expect, it might reject the request altogether.

## Conclusion

CORS errors seem confusing: I often forget that I have to make a server-side change instead of a client-side change to fix them. The ultimate guide to CORS is [MDN's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS): it has lists of every header you might need to include with your server responses, along with detailed descriptions of the values those headers might have. Ultimately, though, CORS errors are solved when you configure your server to allow your frontend application to use the resources that server is providing.
