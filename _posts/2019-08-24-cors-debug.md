title:  "My Thought Process while Debugging a CORS error"
date:   2019-08-24

I've been thinking ([and writing](/blog/2019/cors-1)) about CORS recently because there's a CORS error on the Bowdoin Orient's site. The stylesheets for loading the Orient's fonts are coming up with a CORS error in the Firefox console, while the Chrome console shows CORS errors for both the stylesheet and the font files.

I thought the fix would be fairly easy but a quick diagnostic showed that it's a little more complicated. I'm not sure what the fix is, but I'm going to try to outline my thought process while fixing it to give a sense of how I think about debugging.

- Is this really even a problem? The site looks fine to meâ€”the fonts are showing up fine.
- My computer has the Orient fonts downloaded locally, so maybe the browser is finding the fonts there. I should check on a different computer.
- I checked on my girlfriend's computer. The CORS errors are still showing up in her browser's console, but the fonts look pretty much fine, except for one: Chronicle, font weight 700, not italic.
  - Interestingly enough, 700/italic, 600/regular, and 900/regular are all available. It just seems to be that one weight/style combo.
  - Also interestingly, *every* font coming from the CDN is showing CORS errors in the console, but every font except that one combo looks... totally fine.
  - I wish I could deprioritize the bug given that it's not breaking all the fonts, but the Chronicle 700 font is used as the article headline on the [single.php page](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/post-template-files/#single-php) which is arguably the most viewed part of the website.
- The browsers are complaining that there isn't an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on the response, so let's figure out why not.
- The response headers in the network tag don't have an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header
- When I copy the Curl request, I don't see the headers either:

  ```bash
  $ curl 'https://font-cdn.bowdoinorient.co/files/orient-fonts.css' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0' \
  -H 'Accept: text/css,*/*;q=0.1' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed \
  -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Referer: https://bowdoinorient.com/' \
  -H 'Pragma: no-cache' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -I

  ```

- I checked AWS and the bucket *should* have CORS set up on it. The [CORS troubleshooting documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors-troubleshooting.html)[^1] says there need to be certain criteria met before the CORS-related headers are included in the response.
- I wonder what happens when only use an `Origin` header.

  ```bash
  $ curl 'https://font-cdn.bowdoinorient.co/files/orient-fonts.css' \
  -H 'Origin: https://bowdoinorient.com' -I

- Nice. So CORS is set up properly.
- When I use a `Referer` header instead of an `Origin` header in the request above, it still works. So something in the full request is causing the CORS headers to drop.
- I sequentially added each header in a new CURL request. It wasn't any of the headers, it was the `--compressed` flag.
- I looked up what the `--compressed` flag does for CURL:
  > **`--compressed`** (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms curl supports, and save the uncompressed document. If this option is used and the server sends an unsupported encoding, curl will report an error.
- I thought my S3 configuration was wrong, but maybe it's my Cloudfront configuration; maybe Cloudfront, in compressing the files, is removing the CORS headers that S3 is providing.
- I found a [documentation page about Cloudfront and CORS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/header-caching.html#header-caching-web-cors). I whitelisted four headers in my Cloudfront Default Cache Behavior Settings:
  - `Access-Control-Request-Headers`
  - `Access-Control-Request-Methods`
  - `Origin`
  - `Referer`
- Now none of my CURL requests are giving me any CORS headers in the response; even the ones that used to work
- But the CORS error is gone from Firefox now.[^2]
- And from Chrome.
- After clearing the browser cache, the page looks fine on my girlfriend's computer. I think I fixed this.
- I wonder if I need to clear the Cloudfront cache or add a cachebusting query onto the `<link>` tag.
- The end.

> Update from the next day: It looks like my `orient-fonts.css` file is being requested twice: once from the `<link>` tag and once as an XHR request so that [EQCSS](https://elementqueries.com/) can analyze the stylesheets and render the element queries properly. It's those link tag requests that have the CORS headers, but the XHR requests do not.

If I had any takeaways, they would have to be that debugging these kinds of issues (especially on systems you don't know well) can be tricky, and it helps to have knowledge of the invariants of the system. In this case, I had done my background research on CORS errors so I knew what the ultimate solution would look like: there were response headers that weren't showing up when I expected them to. I also knew that because *some* CURL queries responded with the correct CORS headers, there was a problem with some configuration between S3 and the browser: one of the layers working in there was stripping away the response headers I wanted. I was then able to examine each layer to 

I hope to write this kind of blog post again in the future. Deep-diving and solving these types of problems is an intrinsic part of software development, and I like having insight into the thought processes I go through in order to fix a bug. Hopefully if I do this again I can have points of reference for my problem-solving thought process to see how this skill changes over time.

[^1]: My goodness this page was a slog to find. And it's not even that helpful.

[^2]: This was the most confusing part of debugging. Why does it work in the browser but the proper headers don't show up in CURL?
