Rebecca Goldfine of the Bowdoin Communications Office wrote [a really nice piece](https://www.bowdoin.edu/news/2019/03/james-little-19-teaches-computers-to-teach-themselves.html) about my honors project, where I've been working on synthetic training data for ML models. I'm really thrilled that they wanted to show off my work!
