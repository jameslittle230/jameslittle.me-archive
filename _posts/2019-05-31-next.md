I'm heading back to [Stripe](https://stripe.com) in San Francisco to work on the [Terminal SDK team](https://stripe.com/terminal)!

But yikes, I had a busy spring. I [finished](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByGV9FMANnw/) my [Bowdoin career](/classes), presented and submitted [my thesis](/blog/2019/bowdoin-article), presented some research I had been working on with the Art History department, and ran a Triathlon. Whew!

I'll be at home relaxing for a while, enjoying the hometown I've been away from for the past four years. In July, I'll be moving out to San Francisco, where I've spent the past two summers. We found a cute apartment in the Sunset District, and I'll be spending a bit of time getting settled there. Soon after I move, my friends and I are hoping to hike the [John Muir trail](http://johnmuirtrail.org/). Then, finally, I'll return to Stripe, where I interned in the summer of 2018. I start in early August.

I worked on the iOS Dashboard team at Stripe when I interned there. Since then, I've learned that that team was mildly restructured. I'll be joining the Terminal SDK team, a team which works on Stripe's (brand new) physical point-of-sale product. I got the opportunity to play with Terminal a little bit last summer, and it seems like an awesome product with a really energetic team behind it. I'm really excited to be part of Stripe's foray into the physical world!

For now, I'm resting, reading, spending time with friends and family, and finally taking a look at my long list of projects I wanted to tackle once I got some free time. And, as always, looking forward to what's next.
