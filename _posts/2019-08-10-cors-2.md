## How to fix the errors

I can't describe how to add HTTP headers to responses using every single server technology. The Bowdoin Orient uses CloudFront, which is Amazon AWS's CDN offering, in front of an S3 bucket, to serve its font files.

[^1]: Content Distribution Network: another server whose job it is to cache and serve static files very quickly.

[^3]: If you're reading this to sort out a CORS error you're having, your web browser does not have the right permission because the server has not given it to the browser.
