# Hi, I'm James!

I'm a software developer living in San Francisco and currently working at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) on [Terminal](https://stripe.com/terminal).

**I'm interested in how people interact with technology, and I want to make interfacing with the digital world simpler and more intuitive through the software I create.**

I majored in Computer Science at [Bowdoin College](https://bowdoin.edu). I was the digital director of the [Bowdoin Orient](http://bowdoinorient.com), the weekly student-run newspaper. The website I created and the design work I led helps thousands of people read articles written by our amazing journalists.

I was also the captain of the [Northern Bites](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRY7aBBr3vauc4aQ1PkCt923_ayLOeStW), Bowdoin's RoboCup Soccer team. Our autonomous soccer-playing robots came in ninth place in the RoboCup SPL World Cup in Leipzig, Germany in 2016.

In the summer of 2017, I worked with [Okta](https://okta.com) as a software engineering intern on their mobile development team. I added Touch ID sign-on to [Okta Mobile for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/okta-mobile/id580709251) and carried out a major overhaul of the app's networking framework.

In the summer of 2018, I interned on the mobile team at Stripe, giving the [Stripe Dashboard iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stripe-dashboard/id978516833) a better Balances interface and fixing other small issues.
