- [The Western Digital Red Hard Drive, 8 Terabytes.](https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Bare-Drives-Drive/dp/B07D3MWMNZ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=western+digital+8tb+red&qid=1573269154&s=electronics&sr=1-1) I have 3 of these in my NAS, but the NAS can fit 4.
- Some sort of 2019 wall calendar. I don't have a link for this one to establish a quality baseline, but I will say that it had better be very stylish. I have high standards for this one.
- [The Smart Battery Case for my iPhone.](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRXK2LL/A/iphone-xs-smart-battery-case-black) I don't *need* it, but more battery isn't a bad thing.
- Floor lamp
- Some sort of coffee table book about design or architecture or San Francisco or something
- Smart-home stuff! I've been using LifX lightbulbs, which are good. I'm also in the market for a smart switch or some IP cameras or something. My only guideline is that they work with Homekit or Homebridge -- maybe check with me first if you're not sure.
