- [The AmazonBasics Premium Single Monitor Stand.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MIBN16O?pf_rd_p=183f5289-9dc0-416f-942e-e8f213ef368b&pf_rd_r=BQG1WQBTRXDWZFGBSRNX) Might be able to find a better one on Monoprice. I like how this one looks and I like how it has hydraulics instead of just, like, friction.
- [The Western Digital Red Hard Drive, 8 Terabytes.](https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Bare-Drives-Drive/dp/B07D3MWMNZ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=western+digital+8tb+red&qid=1573269154&s=electronics&sr=1-1) I have 3 of these in my NAS, but the NAS can fit 4.
- [Some sort of UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply).](https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-EC850LCD-Ecologic-Outlets-Compact/dp/B00DBAA696/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=ups&qid=1573269227&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQUJRQlJaSE4xSDlGJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTYzNzQ1MkRUM0UzTVkzWUtMNCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzcyMDM3MjlKWVhIRUc4WUk2RSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) Serves as a big battery so important things don't immediately stop working, and as a power strip.
- [A nice looking wall clock.](https://www.amazon.com/thehaki-Decorative-Non-Ticking-Leather-Lightweight/dp/B06VWBPKX4/ref=pd_ybh_a_6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5V1A8PV5PGEW900SGSH2) I don't have any attachment towards this one. If there's a nicer clock out there, that'd be good too.
- Some sort of 2019 wall calendar. I don't have a link for this one to establish a quality baseline, but I will say that it had better be very stylish. I have high standards for this one.
- [The Smart Battery Case for my iPhone.](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRXK2LL/A/iphone-xs-smart-battery-case-black) I don't *need* it, but more battery isn't a bad thing.
- The next few things are filters for the camera lenses I own.
  - [49mm Circular Polarizer](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/900343-REG/Hoya_calp49crpl_49mm_Alpha_Circular_Polarizer.html)
  - [62mm Circular Polarizer](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/56634-REG/Tiffen_62CP_62mm_Circular_Polarizing.html)
  - [62mm Variable ND Filter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/821125-REG/Tiffen_62VND_62mm_Variable_Neutral_Density.html)
- New pillows for our bed
- Floor lamp
- Some sort of coffee table book about design or architecture or San Francisco or something
