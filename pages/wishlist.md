- [The Western Digital Red Hard Drive, 8 Terabytes.](https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Bare-Drives-Drive/dp/B07D3MWMNZ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=western+digital+8tb+red&qid=1573269154&s=electronics&sr=1-1) I have 3 of these in my NAS, but the NAS can fit 4.
- Some sort of 2020 wall calendar. I don't have a link for this one to establish a quality baseline, but I will say that it had better be very stylish. I have high standards for this one.
- A stylish floor lamp
- Some sort of coffee table book about design or architecture or San Francisco or something
- A gift card for [Green Apple Books](https://www.greenapplebooks.com)
- In a similar vein, a cookbook so we can get better at making dinner!
- Smart-home stuff! I've been using [LifX lightbulbs](https://www.lifx.com/pages/lightbulbs), which are good. I'm also in the market for a smart switch or some IP cameras or some [smart plugs](https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C063/). My only guideline is that they work with Homekit or Homebridge -- maybe check with me first if you're not sure.
- [This L.L.Bean Duffel Bag in Navy](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/121981)
